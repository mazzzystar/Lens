## Why I Built This

I often come across interesting takes online and want AI to analyze them deeply. Every time, I had to:
1. Open Gemini
2. Copy-paste the text
3. Type the same prompt: "What do you think? Give me deep insights"

I wanted a tool to shorten this path so I could browse and think more frequently.

Also: **the internet rewards extreme opinions**. Engagement-driven algorithms amplify the loudest voices, not the most thoughtful ones. We need to browse with our brains turned on.

Lens helps you see past the noise. When you encounter someone's hot take, let AI examine whether the reasoning holds up — or reveal the deeper dynamics at play.

## Privacy

- API key stored locally in Chrome
- Text sent directly to OpenRouter — no intermediate servers
- No analytics or tracking
